# TenderHeart💗

TenderHeart is a Python project that visualizes a mathematical heart shape using plotting libraries. It is designed as a simple, educational example of how mathematics and programming can be combined to create beautiful visualizations.

## Features✨
- Generates a heart-shaped curve using mathematical equations
- Visualizes the heart using Python plotting libraries
- Saves the output as an image (`Figure_1.png`)
- Easy to run and modify for learning or creative purposes

## Requirements⚙️
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)
- `numpy` (for numerical operations)

Install dependencies with:
```pwsh
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage👤
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```pwsh
   python heart.py
   ```
4. The script will display a heart-shaped figure and save it as `Figure_1.png` in the same directory.

## File Descriptions📒
- `heart.py`: Main script that generates and plots the heart shape.
- `Figure_1.png`: Example output image generated by the script.

## How it Works🛠️
The heart shape is generated using parametric equations:

```
x = 16 * sin(t)^3
y = 13 * cos(t) - 5 * cos(2t) - 2 * cos(3t) - cos(4t)
```

Where `t` ranges from 0 to 2π. These equations are plotted using `matplotlib` to create the heart shape.
